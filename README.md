## Project Proposal

Our team engaged in hands-on experience by constructing an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline utilizing Python and Pandas. We used Python dictionaries and Regex methods to efficiently extract and reshape the data. Following the data transformation, we generated four CSV files, which served as the foundation for constructing both an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema. Finally, we imported the CSV data into a Postgres database. 

1. Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames - Nikita

2. Create the Contacts DataFrame(Option 1)- Jihye

3. Inspect the four CSV files, and then sketch an ERD of the tables by using QuickDBD

4. Use the information from the ERD to create a table schema for each CSV file
Extract and transform the data to create DataFrames.

5. Save the database schema as a Postgres file named crowdfunding_db_schema.sql, and save it to your GitHub repository.

6. Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

7. Verify that each table has the correct data by running a SELECT statement for each


## Our team used 
Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Numpy, PostGresSQL, QuickDBD
